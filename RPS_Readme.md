# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. The user plays against the computer (robot), and the game determines whether the player wins, loses, or ties based on standard rules.

## Features

- User chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer (robot) randomly selects its choice.
- The game compares both choices and determines the result (win, lose, or draw).
- ASCII art is used to represent Rock, Paper, and Scissors for a more visual experience.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input a choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors).
2. The computer makes a random selection from Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The game then compares the user's choice with the computer's and prints whether the user won, lost, or tied.
4. The result is displayed alongside the choices made by both the user and the computer.

### Example Usage

```bash
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, and 2 for Scissors: 1
