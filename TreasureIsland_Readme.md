# Treasure Island Adventure Game

Welcome to the **Treasure Island** game! This is a simple text-based adventure where players make decisions that determine their fate. Your mission is to find the treasure, but beware, one wrong choice could end the game!

## Features

- **Interactive Story**: The game progresses based on the player's decisions.
- **Multiple Endings**: Depending on the choices made, players can win or face unfortunate consequences (e.g., falling into a hole, being eaten by crocodiles, etc.).
- **ASCII Art**: The game starts with a treasure map graphic for an enhanced experience.

## How It Works

1. The player starts at a crossroad and makes decisions by typing simple inputs like "left" or "right."
2. Each decision leads to new scenarios, where the player chooses how to proceed (e.g., wait for a boat or swim).
3. Depending on the final choices, the player either wins by finding the treasure or loses by encountering various obstacles.
4. The game ends when the player either finds the treasure or faces an unfortunate event.
